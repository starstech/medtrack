## 📋 **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: Create Production Supabase Project** 🏗️

**Step 1a: Create Supabase Account**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" 
3. Use your email (same one you'll use for the app)
4. Verify your email address

**Step 1b: Create New Project**
1. Click "New Project" 
2. Choose your organization (create one if needed)
3. Fill in project details:
   - **Name:** `medtrack-production` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password:** Generate a strong password (SAVE THIS!)
   - **Region:** Choose closest to your users
   - **Pricing Plan:** Start with Free tier (you can upgrade later)
4. Click "Create new project"
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for project setup to complete

**Step 1c: Save Project Information**
Once created, save these details:
- **Project URL:** `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`
- **Project ID:** Found in project settings
- **API Keys:** Found in Settings > API
  - `anon` key (public)
  - `service_role` key (secret - keep safe!)

### **PHASE 2: Configure Production Database** 🗄️

**Step 2a: Connect to Production Project**
```bash
# In your project directory
cd "/Users/yasser/Cursor Projects/medtrack"

# Link to your production project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```
*Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID from Step 1c*

**Step 2b: Push Database Schema to Production**
```bash
# Push all your migrations to production
supabase db push

# Verify the push worked
supabase db diff
```

**What this does:**
- Uploads all your database tables to production
- Applies all RLS policies
- Sets up functions, triggers, and optimizations
- Creates measurement presets and sample data

**Step 2c: Verify Production Database**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click "Table Editor"
3. Verify all tables are created:
   - ✅ profiles, patients, medications, doses
   - ✅ measurements, measurement_preferences, measurement_presets
   - ✅ daily_logs, files, notifications, user_devices
   - ✅ notification_preferences

---

### **PHASE 3: Set Up Production Environment** 🔧

**Step 3a: Create Production Environment File**
Create `.env.production` in your project root:

```env
# Production Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-production-service-role-key

# Production settings
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=false

# Security settings
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-if-using
```

**Step 3b: Update Keys**
Replace the placeholder values with your actual production keys from Step 1c:
- `your-project-id` ➜ Your actual project ID
- `your-production-anon-key` ➜ Anon key from Supabase dashboard
- `your-production-service-role-key` ➜ Service role key from Supabase dashboard

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:**
- **NEVER** commit `.env.production` to GitHub
- Keep these keys secret and secure
- Use different keys for production vs development

3. Configure **Redirect URLs:**
   - Add your production domain
   - Add any staging domains
4. **Email Templates** (Optional but recommended):
   - Customize signup confirmation email
   - Customize password reset email
   - Add your app branding

**Step 4b: Set Up RLS Policies (Already Done!)**
✅ Your RLS policies are already configured in your migrations
✅ All tables are secured automatically
✅ Users can only see their own data

**Step 4c: Configure CORS Settings**
1. Go to "Settings" > "API"  
2. Add your production domain to allowed origins
