# 🏥 MedTrack Backend Setup Checklist
### Complete Guide for Non-Technical Users

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT STATUS**

### ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:**
1. **Migration files are empty** - Your database won't have any tables
2. **No environment configuration** - App can't connect to database  
3. **Missing setup steps** - Need to populate database with your schemas

### ✅ **WHAT'S ALREADY GOOD:**
- ✅ All SQL schemas are complete and comprehensive
- ✅ All RLS security policies are properly defined
- ✅ All frontend features have backend support
- ✅ Database functions, triggers, and optimizations ready
- ✅ Sample data prepared for testing

---

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP SETUP** 

### **PHASE 1: Fix Migration Files** ⚠️ **(CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)**

**What this does:** Copies your database designs into Supabase migration files

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd "/Users/yasser/Cursor Projects/medtrack"

# Run the setup script to copy all SQL files
./setup-migrations.sh
```

**What you should see:**
```
🚀 Setting up MedTrack Local Supabase Development...
📂 Copying database schema files to migrations...
✅ Copied initial schema
✅ Copied measurement preferences schema
✅ Copied RLS policies
[... more success messages ...]
🎉 Setup complete!
```

**⚠️ If you get permission error:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-migrations.sh
./setup-migrations.sh
```

---

### **PHASE 2: Start Your Database** 🗄️

**What this does:** Creates and starts your local database with all your tables

**Command to run:**
```bash
supabase start
```

**What you should see:**
- Lots of text scrolling (this is normal!)
- Takes 2-5 minutes first time
- Eventually shows a summary with URLs and keys

**Final output looks like:**
```
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
     GraphQL URL: http://localhost:54321/graphql/v1
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
      JWT secret: super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long
        anon key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
service_role key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**🎉 SUCCESS:** Your database is running!

---

### **PHASE 3: Connect Your App** 🔌

**What this does:** Tells your app how to connect to the local database

**Step 3a: Create Environment File**
1. In your project root folder (same level as `package.json`), create a new file called `.env.local`
2. Copy this content into the file:

```env
# Local Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE

# Development settings
NODE_ENV=development
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=local
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

**Step 3b: Fill in the Keys**
- Replace `PASTE_YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE` with the anon key from step 2
- Replace `PASTE_YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE` with the service role key from step 2

**Step 3c: Save the File**
- Save `.env.local` 
- **IMPORTANT:** Never share these keys or put them on GitHub!

---

### **PHASE 4: Test Your Setup** ✅

**Step 4a: View Your Database**
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:54323`
3. You should see Supabase Studio with all your tables!

**Step 4b: Check Your Tables**
In Supabase Studio, click "Table Editor" - you should see:
- ✅ profiles
- ✅ patients  
- ✅ patient_caregivers
- ✅ medications
- ✅ doses
- ✅ measurements
- ✅ measurement_preferences
- ✅ measurement_presets
- ✅ daily_logs
- ✅ files
- ✅ notifications
- ✅ notification_preferences
- ✅ user_devices

**Step 4c: Start Your App**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Step 4d: Test Authentication**
1. Open your app (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
2. Try to sign up with a test email
3. Check if it works without errors
